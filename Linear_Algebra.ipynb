    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, vector spaces (also called linear spaces), linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It is a fundamental tool of quantum mechanics and many other branches of science. Here, we will provide a review of several key concepts needed for understaning of quantum annealing. We will also include code examples in python, so everyone can get familiar with practical aplications of these concepts. \n",

    "A **vector** is a mathematical object characterized by a magnitude and direction. It can be represented in a coordinate system as an array of numbers, each representing a component in a dimension of the space. For example, in a 3-dimensional space, a vector $v$ can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{bmatrix}$ where $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ are the components of $v$ along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The binary operation, called *vector addition* or simply *addition* assigns to any two vectors $\\ket{v}$ and $\\ket{w}$ in $V$ a third vector in $V$ which is commonly written as $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w}$, and called the sum of these two vectors.\n",
    "\n",

    "Any real square matrix A may be decomposed as:      \n",
    "        $A = QR$,      \n",
    "where $Q$ is an *orthogonal matrix* (its columns are orthogonal unit vectors meaning $Q^T = Q^{-1}$) and $R$ is an *upper triangular matrix* (also called *right triangular matrix*). If A is *invertible*, then the factorization is unique if we require the diagonal elements of $R$ to be positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "If instead $A$ is a complex square matrix, then there is a decomposition $A = QR$ where $Q$ is a *unitary matrix* (so the conjugate transpose $Q^{\\dagger }=Q^{-1}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ has $n$ linearly independent columns, then the first $n$ columns of $Q$ form an orthonormal basis for the column space of $A$. More generally, the first $k$ columns of $Q$ form an orthonormal basis for the span of the first $k$ columns of $A$ for any $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. The fact that any column $k$ of $A$ only depends on the first $k$ columns of $Q$ corresponds to the triangular form of $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the QR decomposition\n",
    "Various approaches exist for computing the QR decomposition, each with distinct benefits and drawbacks. In this discussion, we focus on the simplest technique, which employs the Gram-Schmidt process. It's important to note, however, that practical QR decomposition implementations often utilize alternative methods with superior numerical properties.
